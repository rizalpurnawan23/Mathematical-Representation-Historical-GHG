# **A Mathematical Representation of Historical Greenhouse Gas Emissions with Rigorous Insights**

This directory contains the materials of my research paper entitled **A Mathematical
Representation of Historical Greenhouse Gas Emissions with Rigorous Insights**. The files
hosted in this directory are as follows:
1. A [Python script](/Mathematical-Representation-of-Historical-GHG/greenhouse_emission.py)
   containing the algorithmic implementation of the theory in the paper.
2. An [IPython file](/Mathematical-Representation-of-Historical-GHG/math_rep_historical_ghg.ipynb)
   containing the computation of the historical greenhouse gas emission analysis
   implementing the theory in the paper and the algorithmic implementation.
