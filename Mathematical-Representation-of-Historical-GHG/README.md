# **A Mathematical Representation of Historical Greenhouse Gas Emissions with Rigorous Insights**

This directory contains the materials of my research paper entitled **A Mathematical
Representation of Historical Greenhouse Gas Emissions with Rigorous Insights**. The files
hosted in this directory are as follows:
1. A Python script containing the algorithmic implementation of the theory in the paper.
2. A IPython file containing the computation of the historical greenhouse gas emission analysis
   implementing the theory in the paper and the algorithmic implementation.
